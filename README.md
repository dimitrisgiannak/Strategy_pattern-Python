# Strategy_pattern-Python
Coding Bootcamp assignment 3

* On this assignment we needed to use the Strategy pattern on the following scenario:
  
  - Creating a T-shirt with three variations : COLOR , SIZE , FABRIC
  - Each variation has it's own pricing
  - The customer has three different payment methods (Strategy concrete classes)
  - Construct a Strategy  pattern  that  implements  the  variations  and  the  payment methods  
     under  three combined strategies  that  implement  all  the  possible combinations as such:
       1. Color, Size and Fabric with Credit / Debit Cards
       2. Color, Sizeand Fabric with Money / Bank Transfer
       3. Color, Size and Fabri cwith Cash

* I added the ability to buy more T-shirts and in the end display the payment mmethod 
* I used try except methods to 'catch' errors and display appropriate messages. On error
    you can retry

* In order to excecute the project to need to run the client.py file
